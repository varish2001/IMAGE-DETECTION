üìñ About the Project
This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of object detection using Python, OpenCV, and the cvlib library with the YOLOv3 deep learning model. It allows you to analyze images and automatically identify and label common objects such as cars, people, dogs, and more.

Using only a few lines of code, the project performs real-time object detection on static images, providing bounding boxes and confidence scores for each detected object. It's ideal for beginners learning computer vision, as well as for developers looking to build a foundation for more advanced tasks such as real-time surveillance, autonomous driving, or image-based analytics.

Whether you're exploring machine learning, computer vision, or just want to experiment with AI in images, this project offers a practical starting point.

# üß† Object Detection with Python and YOLOv3 (cvlib)

This project demonstrates object detection using Python, OpenCV, and the `cvlib` library with the YOLOv3 model. It detects common objects like people, cars, and animals in static images, drawing bounding boxes with confidence scores.
